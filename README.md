# Vehicle-Based Road Damage Detection System
A Python-based backend system designed to detect road damages using data captured from vehicle sensors or camera feeds. 
This project aims to support smart city infrastructure by automating the monitoring of road conditions.

## Features
- Detects potholes, cracks, and surface damage
- Uses vehicle-generated data or video/image input
- Outputs Voice alerts or logs for damaged locations
- Modular and lightweight backend for integration with mobile or IoT systems
  
##  Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Flask (optional for API)  
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter Notebook/VS Code  
- **Dataset**: Simulated or captured road damage images/videos
  
##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the script
   
## Future Improvements
Real-time video input via dashcam  
GPS tagging for mapped damage logging  
Integration with cloud dashboard or mobile app
